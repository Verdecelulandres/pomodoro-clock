This is a 25 + 5 timer clock. This program can be used to take advantage of the pomodoro study technique. 
I prefer calling it Pomodoro clock because It can be time customizable.

This is the 5th and last project for the FCC front end libraries certification project.
https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-25--5-clock

This project uses the React and bootstrap libraries.

Only passed 25/29 tests due to incompatibilities with react and the test bundle.
